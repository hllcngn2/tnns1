start with the zoom
use that aspect ratio only at the moment of drawing

draw.c:
//field of view
//- position & distances are also scaled to the zoom
//- fix constants

main.c:
-new game (generate farm terrain)
-save game
-load game

-collisions

gen.c:
different gen options:
//actual probabilities
//Perlin noise
//1-2 bushes a tile
//different sizes of bush

// 2) ordering sprites for display

tnns.h:
//- add specific sprites base sizes
//or find an other solution
fix size/ratio constants

structures:
typedef struct {
} Tile;
typedef Tile** Terrain;

// player
//first name
//family name
